      <h3>Your feedback improves Company X products!</h3>
            <!-- (or) we're excited you're here -->
      <p>
        We want you to shape the direction of the future products from Company X. Your involvement helps the products to be more intuitive, easy to use, and direct the future of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a project, we may ask for your feedback on existing products, new products, prototypes, or concepts for new products. We may also ask about some of your regular habits, how you interact with the people around you, or specific use scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't have to be an existing Company X user to sign up. We highly value what we learn from people who don't use Company X products, and are unfamiliar with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Company X, we care about making products that are intuitive and feel effortless to use. But, we can't do that without your feedback and thoughts.
      </p>
      <h4>Who participates?</h4>
      <p>
        You! Company X products and technologies are used across the globe by nearly every demographic. Whatever your age or experience level with Company X products, we want your feedback on our products. Kids, teens, adults – everyone can participate and change the future of technology. Of course, if you're under 17 you'll have to have a parent or guardian’s permission.
      </p>
      <h4>What you’ll do</h4>
      <p>
        You’ll try out new technology, or show us how you use products every day. Our researchers will ask questions and want your honest feedback. You might participate in a study at our campuses (most are in Austin, TX), or you might provide us feedback online, participate in a focus group, or choose to get a visit from a researcher. We have many different ways of evaluating software and hardware, and we make every effort to ensure participation will be easy and rewarding for you.
